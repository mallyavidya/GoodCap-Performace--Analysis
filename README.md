###  Background  
Good Cabs, a fast-growing urban mobility service provider, needed insights into its trip volume, passenger satisfaction, and city-level performance.

- Understand trends in trips, revenue, and customer behavior  
- Identify cities with growth opportunities or concerns  
- Compare new vs repeat customer dynamics  
- Track performance against targets at city and company level
